# Used Car Price Prediction

## Description
This project aims to predict the selling price of used cars based on various features such as year, mileage, and engine size. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), outlier detection, and model building using different regression techniques.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- statsmodels

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels```


## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the `CarPredictionPrice.ipynb` file.
2. Place the `cardekho.csv` dataset in the same directory as the notebook.
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
4. Run the cells sequentially to perform data analysis and model training.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Outlier detection and handling
- Feature importance analysis
- Multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)

## Results
The project provides insights into the factors affecting used car prices and evaluates the performance of different regression models using metrics like R-squared and RMSE.
